Tippy elements use a simple CSS transition by default. The main CSS file
includes two animations: `fade` and `shift-away`.

### Usage

Pass the animation name (string) as the `animation` prop:

```js
tippy('button', {
  animation: 'fade',
})
```

### Extra animations

There are 3 extra animations included in the package: `scale`, `perspective`,
and `shift-toward`. You'll need to import these separately.

Each of these 3 animations also has 3 variants (normal, subtle, and extreme).

Node:

```js
import 'tippy.js/animations/scale.css'
import 'tippy.js/animations/scale-subtle.css'
import 'tippy.js/animations/scale-extreme.css'
// `perspective` and `shift-toward` follow the same format as above
```

Browser:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@5/animations/scale.css"
/>
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@5/animations/scale-extreme.css"
/>
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@5/animations/scale-subtle.css"
/>
```

### Custom animations

If the extra packaged animations don't suit your use case, you can create your
own.

You'll need to:

- Use your own animation name in the `[data-animation]` attribute selector
- Target the visibility state of the tippy: `[data-state="hidden"]` or
  `[data-state="visible"]`
- Depending on the animation, target the placement of the tippy too: e.g.
  `[data-placement^="top"]`

```css
.tippy-tooltip[data-animation='my-animation'][data-state='hidden'] {
  transform: rotate(90deg);
}
```

```js
tippy('button', {
  animation: 'my-animation',
})
```

### Inertia

There's a prop named `inertia` that adds an elastic inertial effect to the
tippy, which is a limited CSS-only way to mimic spring physics.

```js
tippy('button', {
  inertia: true,
})
```

You can customize this prop in your CSS:

```css
.tippy-tooltip[data-inertia][data-state='visible'] {
  transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(...);
}
```

### CSS animations

Maybe plain transitions aren't enough for your use case. You can also use CSS
animations (e.g. `animate.css`):

```js
tippy('button', {
  // 'fade' is just an opacity transition, which is a good base for most
  // animations
  animation: 'fade',
  onMount(instance) {
    const { tooltip } = instance.popperChildren
    requestAnimationFrame(() => {
      tooltip.classList.add('animated')
      tooltip.classList.add('wobble')
    })
  },
  onHidden(instance) {
    const { tooltip } = instance.popperChildren
    tooltip.classList.remove('animated')
    tooltip.classList.remove('wobble')
  },
})
```

You can also use `@keyframes` and add the `animation` property to your animation
selector too.

### Spring animations

Maybe CSS is too limiting and want the full power of a JavaScript animation
library. `animejs` is a great library for creating realistic spring animations.

Here's an example of how to integrate it:

```js
tippy('button', {
  content: 'Hello world',
  duration: 0, // Required to not interfere
  onShow(instance) {
    const { tooltip } = instance.popperChildren

    anime.remove(tooltip)
    anime({
      targets: tooltip,
      scale: [0.75, 1],
      translateY: [15, 0],
      opacity: [0, 1],
      duration: 1000,
    })
  },
  onHide(instance) {
    const { tooltip } = instance.popperChildren

    // Prevent an infinite loop by using a state flag
    if (instance.state.hideCalledManually) {
      instance.state.hideCalledManually = false
      return
    }

    anime.remove(tooltip)
    anime({
      targets: tooltip,
      scale: [1, 0.75],
      opacity: [1, 0],
      translateY: [0, 15],
      duration: 200,
      easing: 'easeInQuad',
      complete() {
        if (!instance.state.isVisible) {
          instance.state.hideCalledManually = true
          instance.hide()
        }
      },
    })

    // We're going to call `.hide()` ourselves - we need to wait for
    // animejs to complete its animation. We can cancel the lifecycle
    // by returning `false`.

    // We also need to set the `isVisible` state flag to `false`
    // manually so the instance knows the tippy is currently hiding.
    instance.state.isVisible = false
    return false
  },
})
```

### Dimensions transition

While a tippy is showing, the content inside of it may change. How do you
smoothly transition its dimensions? By default, it instantly changes size when
the content is updated. It turns out this is quite complex to do, but possible.

#### Partially dynamic

View the [CodePen demo](https://codepen.io/atomiks/pen/LgjMbW).

#### Fully dynamic

<Demo>
  <DimensionsTransition />
</Demo>

Code: TBD

Edge cases need to be worked out first. Highly experimental and buggy at this
stage. There is no API wrapper for this yet as it's only being recently
developed.
