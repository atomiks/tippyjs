### Instance methods

Methods on instances allow you to control the tippy programmatically. See the
[Tippy Instance](../tippy-instance/) page for details on accessing an instance.

#### show

Programmatically show the tippy at any time:

```js
instance.show();
```

#### hide

Programmatically hide the tippy at any time:

```js
instance.hide();
```

#### hideWithInteractivity

> Available from `v6.2.0`

Will hide the tippy only if the cursor is outside of the tippy's interactive
region. This allows you to programmatically hook into `interactive` behavior
upon a `mouseleave` event if implementing custom event listeners.

```js
// Required: pass the mouse event object in from your event listener
instance.hideWithInteractivity(mouseEvent);
```

#### disable

Temporarily prevent a tippy from showing or hiding:

```js
instance.disable();
```

#### enable

Re-enable a tippy:

```js
instance.enable();
```

#### setProps

You can update any prop after the instance has been created. Pass an object of
new props in:

```js
instance.setProps({
  arrow: true,
  animation: 'scale',
});
```

#### setContent

Updating the `content` prop has its own method as a shortcut:

```js
instance.setContent('New content');
```

#### unmount

Unmount the tippy from the DOM:

```js
instance.unmount();
```

This allows you to integrate spring animation libraries as an alternative to
CSS. For instance, you'd call this in their `onComplete()` (or equivalent)
callback.

#### clearDelayTimeouts

Clears the instance's `delay` timeouts. There will likely be only very rare use
cases for this.

```js
instance.clearDelayTimeouts();
```

#### destroy

To permanently destroy and clean up the instance, use this method:

```js
instance.destroy();
```

The `_tippy` property is deleted from the reference element upon destruction.

### Static methods

Static methods belong to the `tippy` module for global behavior.

#### setDefaultProps

Set the default props for each new instance:

```js
tippy.setDefaultProps({
  // Props
});

// Access the current default props
tippy.defaultProps;
```

#### hideAll

Hide all visible tippies on the document:

```js
import {hideAll} from 'tippy.js';

// Use each tippy's own duration
hideAll();
// Hide them all instantly
hideAll({duration: 0});
// Hide them all except a particular one
hideAll({exclude: tippyInstance});
hideAll({exclude: referenceElement});
```

In the CDN (`umd`) version, it's available as `tippy.hideAll()`.
