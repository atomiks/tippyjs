### What syntax theme is used on this website?

It's a theme I made called
[Moonlight](https://github.com/atomiks/moonlight-vscode-theme)!

### I can't click things inside the tooltip

To enable interactivity, set the `interactive` prop to `true`.

### My tooltip is hiding instantly after showing

If you're using a `focus` trigger, for example on an `<input>`, make sure you
also set `hideOnClick: false`.

### My tooltip is not working using `data-tippy`

Make sure Tippy's scripts are placed _before_ your own scripts, at the very
bottom of the page, like so:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button data-tippy="Created automatically">Text</button>
    <button data-tippy-content="Created by function">Text</button>

    <!-- Very end of the body -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/popper.js@1"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@5"></script>
    <script>
      tippy('button')
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Changing data-tippy-\* attributes does not update the tooltip

Updating the data-tippy-\* attribute on an element will currently not update the
tooltip. You must use the [`set()` method](/methods#update-the-tippy) on a Tippy
instance.

For example, let's say you want to update the `theme` for tooltips when changing
between dark and light mode:

```js
const instances = tippy('.example', {
  theme: 'custom-dark',
})

// When clicking the theme toggle button, you can do this:
const newTheme = 'whatever'
instances.forEach(instance => {
  instance.setProps({ theme: newTheme })
})
```

It's also possible to attach a `MutationObserver` to the reference elements and
observe mutations to attributes if need be, then call `.set()` with the new
values.

### Can I use the `title` attribute?

Yes. The `content` prop can be a function that receives the reference element as
an argument and returns a string or element.

```js
tippy('button', {
  content(reference) {
    const title = reference.getAttribute('title')
    reference.removeAttribute('title')
    return title
  },
})
```

The `title` attribute should be removed once you have its content so the
browser's default tooltip isn't displayed along with the tippy.

It's recommended to create a new proxy (wrapper) function to extend the base
`tippy()` module's functionality.

```js
// You can call this whatever you want
function tippy2(targets, optionalProps) {
  return tippy(targets, {
    ...optionalProps,
    content(reference) {
      if (optionalProps.content) {
        return optionalProps.content
      }

      const title = reference.getAttribute('title')
      reference.removeAttribute('title')

      return title
    },
  })
}

// Everywhere in your application
tippy2('button') // <button title="Hello world" /> now works!
```

Note that the above `tippy2` function does not take into consideration the
`setProps()` method. There are some edge cases you should look out for.
