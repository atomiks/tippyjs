| Prop | Default | Description |
| --- | :-: | --- |
| `allowHTML` | `true` | **Determines if the tippy can have HTML content rendered inside of it.** <br /><br /> Make sure you are sanitizing any user data if rendering HTML to prevent XSS attacks. |
| **`animateFill`** (available as a [plugin](/plugins/)) | `false` | **Determines if the background fill color of the tippy should be animated.** <br /><br /> You must import the `dist/backdrop.css` & `animations/shift-away.css` stylesheets for styling to work. |
| `animation` | `"fade"` | **The type of transition animation.** <br /><br /> See [Animations](/animations/) for details. |
| `appendTo` | `document.body` | **The element to append the tippy to.** <br /><br /> Possible values: `"parent"` (the reference's parentNode), `Element`, `(reference) => Element`. <br /><br /> If `interactive: true`, the default behavior is `appendTo: "parent"` instead of `document.body`. <br /><br /> See [Accessibility](/accessibility/#interactivity) for more information. |
| `aria` | `"describedby"` | **The `aria-*` attribute applied to the reference element.** <br /><br /> Possible values: `"describedby"`, `"labelledby"`. Use `null` to prevent the attribute from being added. |
| `arrow` | `true` | **Determines if the tippy has an arrow.** <br /><br /> Possible values: `boolean`, `string` (HTML), or `SVGElement` (your own shape). <br /><br /> To use the default round arrow, import `roundArrow` from the package (`tippy.roundArrow` in IIFE version) and pass it as the value. <br /><br /> You must also import `dist/svg-arrow.css` when using SVG arrows for styling to work. |
| `boundary` | `"scrollParent"` | **The boundary that Popper.js' `preventOverflow` modifier adheres to.** <br /><br /> Possible values: `"scrollParent"`, `"window"`, `"viewport"`, or an `HTMLElement`. |
| `content` | `""` | **The content of the tippy.** <br /><br /> Possible values: `string`, `Element`, or `(reference) => Element`. |
| `delay` | `0` | **Delay in ms once a trigger event is fired before a tippy shows or hides.** <br /><br /> Possibles values: `number`, `[number, number]` = [show, hide]. <br /><br /> Specifying a number means both the show and hide delays are the same. Use `null` in the array to use the default value. |
| `distance` | `10` | **How far in pixels the tippy element is from the reference element.** <br /><br /> Possible values: `number` (px), `string` (with units). <br /><br /> Only applies to a single axis and not to the parent popper element, see the `offset` prop. |
| `duration` | `[275, 250]` | **Duration of the CSS transition animation in ms.** <br /><br /> Possibles values: `number`, `[number, number]` = [show, hide]. <br /><br /> Specifying a number means both the show and hide delays are the same. Use `null` in the array to use the default value. |
| `flip` | `true` | **Determines if the tippy flips so that it is placed within the viewport as best it can be if there is not enough space.** |
| `flipBehavior` | `"flip"` | **Determines the order of flipping, i.e. which placements to prefer if a certain placement cannot be used.** <br /><br /> Use an array such as `["bottom", "left"]` to prefer the "left" placement if "bottom" is unavailable, instead of "top". |
| `flipOnUpdate` | `false` | **Determines if the tippy should flip when necessary if its position updates while showing (for example, while scrolling, resize, or if the size of the tooltip changed).** |
| **`followCursor`** (available as a [plugin](/plugins/)) | `false` | **Determines if the tippy follows the user's mouse cursor.** <br /><br /> Use the strings `"vertical"` or `"horizontal"` to only follow the cursor on a single axis. <br /><br /> Use `"initial"` to place the tippy at the initial cursor position upon show, but prevent following it. <br /><br /> On touch devices, `"initial"` is the behavior for all truthy values. |
| `hideOnClick` | `true` | **Determines if the tippy should hide if a mousedown event was fired outside of it (i.e. clicking on the reference element or the body of the page).** <br /><br /> For click-triggered tippies, using `false` will prevent the tippy from ever hiding once it is showing. <br /><br /> To prevent clicks outside of the tippy from hiding it but still allow it to be toggled, use the string `"toggle"`. |
| `ignoreAttributes` | `false` | **Determines if `data-tippy-*` attributes on the reference element should be ignored.** <br /><br /> Increases performance if you enable it. |
| `inertia` | `false` | **Determines if an inertial slingshot effect is applied to the CSS animation.** |
| **`inlinePositioning`** (available as a [plugin](/plugins/)) | `false` | **Adds enhanced support for inline element positioning (`display: inline`).** <br /><br /> Automatically detects inline elements and positions the tippy correctly. |
| `interactive` | `false` | **Determines if the tippy is interactive, i.e. it can be hovered over or clicked without hiding.** <br /><br /> If your tippy appears cut off or invisible, [see the FAQ](https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/faq/#my-tooltip-appears-cut-off-or-is-not-showing-at-all) for solutions. |
| `interactiveBorder` | `2` | **Determines the size in pixels of the invisible border around a tippy which will prevent it from hiding if the cursor left it.** |
| `interactiveDebounce` | `0` | **Number in ms to debounces the internal `onMouseMove` handler which determines when an interactive tippy should hide.** |
| `lazy` | `true` | **Determines if the positioning engine (powered by Popper.js) is created lazily. That is, it's only created when necessary upon showing the tippy for the first time.** <br /><br /> If you need to access the `popperInstance` synchronously after creation, set this to `false`. Note that disabling this decreases performance considerably. |
| `maxWidth` | `350` | **Determines the maximum width of the tippy.** <br /><br /> Use a `number` for pixels, or a `string` to add units such as `rem`, or `"none"`. |
| `multiple` | `false` | **Determines if the reference element can have multiple tippies applied to it.** |
| `offset` | `0` | **Determines the offset of the tippy element.** <br /> <br /> Unlike `distance`, it can work on both axes by using a string in the form `"x, y"`, such as `"50, 20"`. <br /><br /> Avoid using an `offset` along the same axis as the `placement` prop if using `interactive: true`. If using a `number`, there won't be any problems. |
| `onAfterUpdate` | `noop` | **Lifecycle hook invoked after the tippy's props have been updated.** |
| `onBeforeUpdate` | `noop` | **Lifecycle hook invoked before the tippy's props have been updated.** |
| `onCreate` | `noop` | **Lifecycle hook invoked when the tippy has has been created.** |
| `onDestroy` | `noop` | **Lifecycle hook invoked when the tippy has has been destroyed.** |
| `onHidden` | `noop` | **Lifecycle hook invoked when the tippy has fully transitioned out and is unmounted from the DOM.** |
| `onHide` | `noop` | **Lifecycle hook invoked when the tippy begins to transition out.** <br /><br /> You can cancel hiding by returning `false` from this lifecycle. |
| `onMount` | `noop` | **Lifecycle hook invoked when the tippy has been mounted to the DOM (called after `onShow`).** |
| `onShow` | `noop` | **Lifecycle hook invoked when the tippy begins to transition in.** <br /><br /> You can cancel showing by returning `false` from this lifecycle. |
| `onShown` | `noop` | **Lifecycle hook invoked when the tippy has fully transitioned in.** |
| `onTrigger` | `noop` | **Lifecycle hook invoked when the tippy was triggered by a real DOM event (called before `onShow`) to show the tippy.** |
| `onUntrigger` | `noop` | **Lifecycle hook invoked when the tippy was triggered by a real DOM event (called before `onHide`) to hide the tippy.** |
| `placement` | `"top"` | **Positions the tippy relative to its reference element.** <br /><br /> Use the suffix `-start` or `-end` to shift the tippy to the start or end of the reference element, instead of centering it. For example, `"top-start"` or `"left-end"`. |
| `plugins` | `[]` | **Specify plugins to use.** <br /><br /> See [Plugins](/plugins/) for details. |
| `popperOptions` | `{}` | **Specify custom Popper.js options.** <br /><br /> See the [Popper.js documentation](https://popper.js.org/popper-documentation.html) for more. |
| `role` | `"tooltip"` | **Specifies the `role` attribute on the tippy element.** |
| `showOnCreate` | `false` | **Determines if the tippy will be shown immediately once the instance is created.** |
| **`sticky`** (available as a [plugin](/plugins/)) | `false` | **Ensures the tippy stays stuck to its reference element if it moves around or changes size while showing.** <br /><br /> Use `true` to check both `reference` and `popper` DOM rects, or use the strings `"reference"` or `"popper"` to check only one rect for improved performance (both are checked by default). <br /><br /> See the `updateDuration` prop to change the transition duration between position updates. |
| `theme` | `""` | **Themes added as classes (each separated by a space) to the tippy element's `classList`.** <br /><br /> See [Themes](/themes/) for details. |
| `touch` | `true` | **Determines if the tippy displays if the user is currently using touch input.** <br /><br /> Possible values: `boolean`, `"hold"`, `["hold", number]`. <br /><br /> Use `"hold"` to use `touch` listeners instead, and e.g. `["hold", 500]` to simulate "long press" behavior. |
| `trigger` | `"mouseenter focus"` | **The events (each separated by a space) which cause a tippy to show.** <br /><br /> Possible values: `"mouseenter"`, `"focus"`, `"click"`, `"manual"`. <br /><br /> Use `"manual"` to only trigger the tippy programmatically. |
| `triggerTarget` | `null` | **Which element(s) the `trigger` event listeners are applied to instead of the reference element.** <br /><br /> Possible values: `null`, `Element`, or `Element[]`. |
| `updateDuration` | `0` | **The transition duration between position updates of the popper element.** <br/><br /> Useful for the `sticky` and `flipOnUpdate` props. |
| `zIndex` | `9999` | **Determines the `z-index` of the tippy.** |
