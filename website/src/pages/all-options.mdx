| `appendTo`                        |  `Element`, `Function`   |   `document.body`    | The element to append the tippy to. You can define a function that takes the reference element as an argument and returns an new element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `arrow`                           |        `boolean`         |       `false`        | Determines if an arrow should be added to the tippy pointing toward the reference element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Possible values: `"sharp"`, `"round"`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ~~`arrowTransform`~~ (deprecated) |         `string`         |         `""`         | CSS transform applied to the arrow. Due to flipping, it is dynamic â€“ supply a string that would give the desired transform for the `"top"` placement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `content`                         |   `string`, `Element`    |         `"`          | The content of the tippy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `delay`                           | `number`, `[show, hide]` |      `[0, 20]`       | Delay in ms once a trigger event is fired before a tippy shows or hides. Specifying a number means both the show and hide delays are the same. Use `null` in the array to use the default value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `duration`                        | `number`, `[show, hide]` |     `[275, 250]`     | Duration of the CSS transition animation in ms. Specifying a number means both the show and hide delays are the same. Use `null` in the array to use the default value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `distance`                        |         `number`         |         `10`         | How far in pixels the tippy element is from the reference element. Only applies to a single axis and not to the parent popper element, see offset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `flip`                            |        `boolean`         |        `true`        | Determines if the tippy flips so that it is placed within the viewport as best it can be if there is not enough room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `flipBehavior`                    |   `string`, `string[]`   |       `"flip"`       | Determines the order of flipping, i.e. which placements to prefer if a certain placement cannot be used. Use an array such as `["bottom", "left"]` to prefer the "left" placement if "bottom" is unavailable, instead of "top".                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `followCursor`                    |   `boolean`, `string`    |       `false`        | Determines if the tippy follows the user's mouse cursor while showing. Use the strings `"vertical"` or `"horizontal"` to only follow the cursor on a single axis. <!-- Use `"initial"` to place the tippy at the initial cursor position upon show, but prevent following it. -->                                                                                                                                      |
| `hideOnClick`                     |   `boolean`, `string`    |        `true`        | Determines if the tippy should hide if a click event was fired outside of it (i.e. clicking on the reference or the body). For click-triggered tippys, using `false` will prevent the tippy from ever hiding once it is showing. To prevent clicks outside of the tippy from hiding it but still allow it to be toggled, use the string `"toggle"`.                                                                    |
| `inertia`                         |        `boolean`         |       `false`        | Determines if an inertial slingshot effect is applied to the CSS transition-timingfunction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `interactive`                     |        `boolean`         |       `false`        | Determines if the tippy is interactive, i.e. it can be hovered over or clicked without hiding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `interactiveBorder`               |         `number`         |         `2`          | Determines the size in pixels of the invisible border around a tippy which will prevent it from closing if the cursor left the element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `interactiveDebounce`             |         `number`         |         `0`          | Debounces the internal `onMouseMove` handler which determines when an interactive tippy should hide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `lazy`                            |        `boolean`         |        `true`        | Determines if the positioning engine (powered by Popper.js) is created lazily. That is, it's only created when necessary upon showing the tippy for the first time. If you need to access the `popperInstance` synchronously after creation, set this to `false`. Please note that this decreases performance considerably.                                                                                            |
| `livePlacement`                   |        `boolean`         |        `true`        | Determines if the placement of the tippy should update on scroll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `maxWidth`                        |    `number`, `string`    |         `""`         | Determines the maximum width of the tippy - use a number for pixels, or a string to add units such as rem. In CSS, it's defined as `350px` by default. This option applies the width to the `style` attribute of the tippy element.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `multiple`                        |        `boolean`         |       `false`        | Determines if the reference element can have multiple tippys applied to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `offset`                          |    `number`, `string`    |    `0`, `string`     | Determines the offset of the tippy element. Unlike `distance`, it can work with both the `x` and `y` axes, however, the `interactive` option may break.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Use the suffix `-start` or `-end` to shift the tippy to the start or end of the reference element, instead of centering it. For example, `top-start` or `left-end`.                                                                                                                                                                                             |

See the [Popper.js documentation](https://popper.js.org/popper-documentation.html) for more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `shouldPopperHideOnBlur`          |        `Function`        |        `noop`        | A function that takes the `focusout` event object returns a boolean to determine if the popper element should hide if it's blurred (applies only if interactive). If the popper element is blurred (i.e. no elements within it are in focus), the popper is hidden. However, there are cases in which you may need to keep it visible even when not in focus.                                                          |
| `showOnInit`                      |        `boolean`         |       `false`        | Determines if the tippy will be shown immediately once the instance is created. If using on page load, use sticky: true because the reference element can move around while the layout gets built by the browser after initialization (unless the layout is guaranteed to be static).                                                                                                                                  |

Possible values: `"small"`, `"regular"`, `"large"`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

See the `updateDuration` option to change the transition duration between position updates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Instead of a tap on the reference to show and a tap elsewhere to hide the tippy, the reference must be pressed and held for the tippy to show. Letting go from the screen will hide it. To prevent the mobile context menu from appearing, ensure the element cannot be selected using user-select: none; and/or prevent the default behavior for the contextmenu event. |
| `trigger`                         |         `string`         | `"mouseenter focus"` | The events (each separated by a space) which cause a tippy to show. Possible values: `"mouseenter"`, `"focus"`, `"click"`, `"manual"`. Use `"manual"` to only trigger the tippy programmatically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
