### What syntax theme is used on this website?

It's a theme I made called
[Moonlight](https://github.com/atomiks/moonlight-vscode-theme)!

### I'm getting Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined

If you're using the ESM/CJS versions and importing like this:

```js
import tippy from 'tippy.js'
```

Tippy uses a special expression to distinguish a development and production
environment. For you, the developer, there are lots of warnings and error
messages to help your development experience. For your end users, all of this
needs to get stripped out because it reduces performance and increases bundle
size.

You'll need to configure your bundler to handle development and production
versions. Tools like `create-react-app` handle this automatically.

#### Parcel

You shouldn't need to configure anything. Parcel handles this for you.

#### Webpack

You need to use [`DefinePlugin`](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/define-plugin/)
and ensure your development and production build pipelines set `NODE_ENV` as
either `development` or `production`. This is considered a "standard" env
variable for various tools.

```js
// Inside your plugins array
new webpack.DefinePlugin({
  'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV),
})
```

#### Rollup

You need to use the
[`replace plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-replace) and
ensure your development and production build pipelines set `NODE_ENV` as either
`development` or `production`. This is considered a "standard" env variable for
various tools.

```js
import replace from 'rollup-plugin-replace'

// Inside your plugins array
replace({
  'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV),
})
```

### I can't click things inside the tooltip

To enable interactivity, set the `interactive` prop to `true`.

### My tooltip is hiding instantly after showing

If you're using a `focus` trigger, for example on an `<input>`, make sure you
also set `hideOnClick: false`.

### My tooltip is not working using `data-tippy`

Make sure Tippy's scripts are placed _before_ your own scripts, at the very
bottom of the page, like so:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button data-tippy="Created automatically">Text</button>
    <button data-tippy-content="Created by function">Text</button>

    <!-- Very end of the body -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/popper.js@1"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@5"></script>
    <script>
      tippy('button')
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Changing data-tippy-\* attributes does not update the tooltip

Updating the data-tippy-\* attribute on an element will currently not update the
tooltip. You must use the [`setProps()` method](/methods#setProps) on a Tippy
instance.

For example, let's say you want to update the `theme` for tooltips when changing
between dark and light mode:

```js
const instances = tippy('.example', {
  theme: 'custom-dark',
})

// When clicking the theme toggle button, you can do this:
const newTheme = 'whatever'
instances.forEach(instance => {
  instance.setProps({ theme: newTheme })
})
```

It's also possible to attach a `MutationObserver` to the reference elements and
observe mutations to attributes if need be, then call `.setProps()` with the new
values.

### Can I use the `title` attribute?

Yes. The `content` prop can be a function that receives the reference element as
an argument and returns a string or element.

```js
tippy('button', {
  content(reference) {
    const title = reference.getAttribute('title')
    reference.removeAttribute('title')
    return title
  },
})
```

The `title` attribute should be removed once you have its content so the
browser's default tooltip isn't displayed along with the tippy.

It's recommended to create a new proxy (wrapper) function to extend the base
`tippy()` module's functionality.

```js
// You can call this whatever you want
function tippy2(targets, optionalProps) {
  return tippy(targets, {
    ...optionalProps,
    content(reference) {
      if (optionalProps.content) {
        return optionalProps.content
      }

      const title = reference.getAttribute('title')
      reference.removeAttribute('title')

      return title
    },
  })
}

// Everywhere in your application
tippy2('button') // <button title="Hello world" /> now works!
```

Note that the above `tippy2` function does not take into consideration the
`setProps()` method. There are some edge cases you should look out for.
