Initiating AJAX requests is facilitated by lifecycle hooks. This allows you to
do very powerful things. For example, let's say you wanted to show a new image
inside a tooltip each time it gets shown:

<Demo>
  <Ajax>Hover for a new image</Ajax>
</Demo>

Let's walk through a little tutorial to learn how to do this.

First, let's setup our HTML:

```html
<button id="ajax-tippy">Hover for a new image</button>
```

Now, let's add some JavaScript:

```js
tippy('#ajax-tippy', {
  content: 'Loading...',
  // This prop is recommended if your tooltip changes size while showing
  flipOnUpdate: true,
});
```

Here's the result so far (nothing happens yet!):

<Demo>
  <Tippy content="Loading..." animation="fade" animateFill={false}>
    <Button>Hover for a new image</Button>
  </Tippy>
</Demo>

To initiate the AJAX request every time the tippy shows, use the `onShow`
lifecycle:

```js
tippy('#ajax-tippy', {
  content: 'Loading...',
  flipOnUpdate: true,
  onShow(instance) {
    // Code here is executed every time the tippy shows
  },
});
```

Modern browsers support the `fetch` API, so we'll use it for this example
because it's cleaner than `XMLHttpRequest`. We are using an Unsplash API to
fetch a random 200x200 image:

```js
tippy('#ajax-tippy', {
  // ...
  onShow(instance) {
    fetch('https://unsplash.it/200/?random')
      .then(response => response.blob())
      .then(blob => {
        // Convert the blob into a URL
        const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
        // Create an image
        const image = new Image();
        image.width = 200;
        image.height = 200;
        image.style.display = 'block';
        image.src = url;
        // Update the tippy content with the image
        instance.setContent(image);
      });
  },
});
```

<Demo>
  <Tippy
    content="Loading..."
    onShow={instance => {
      fetch('https://unsplash.it/200/?random')
        .then(response => response.blob())
        .then(blob => {
          // Convert the blob into a URL
          const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
          // Create an image
          const image = new Image();
          image.width = 200;
          image.height = 200;
          image.style.display = 'block';
          image.src = url;
          // Update the tippy content with the image
          instance.setContent(image);
        })
        .catch(error => {
          // Fallback if the network request failed
          instance.setContent(`Request failed. ${error}`);
        });
    }}
  >
    <Button>Hover for a new image</Button>
  </Tippy>
</Demo>

There are currently two problems with this:

- When the tippy is hidden, it doesn't reset back to `Loading...`
- If you quickly hover in and out of the tippy, it initiates many different
  requests and each image rapidly replaces the old one as each request finishes.

The first one can be solved by using the `onHidden` lifecycle, which is executed
once the tippy fully transitions out and is unmounted from the DOM:

```js
tippy('#ajax-tippy', {
  // ...
  onHidden(instance) {
    instance.setContent('Loading...');
  },
});
```

The second one is trickier and requires using state. This will let us know the
current condition the tooltip is in.

```js
tippy('#ajax-tippy', {
  // ...
  onCreate(instance) {
    // Attach a state object to keep track of the request status
    instance.ajaxState = {
      isFetching: false,
      canFetch: true,
    };
  },
  onShow(instance) {
    // Now we will avoid initiating a new request unless the old one
    // finished (`isFetching`).
    // We also only want to initiate a request if the tooltip has been
    // reset back to Loading... (`canFetch`).
    if (instance.ajaxState.isFetching || !instance.ajaxState.canFetch) {
      return;
    }

    instance.ajaxState.isFetching = true;

    fetch('https://unsplash.it/200/?random')
      .then(response => response.blob())
      .then(blob => {
        // ...
      })
      .catch(error => {
        // ...
      })
      .finally(() => {
        // Make sure to set it back to false so new requests can be
        // initiated
        instance.ajaxState.isFetching = false;
      });
  },
  onHidden(instance) {
    instance.setContent('Loading...');
    instance.ajaxState.canFetch = true;
  },
});
```

We use state to keep track of the request's status. Without the state booleans,
unexpected effects may occur, such as initiating too many requests before
waiting for the previous one to finish, or showing new images before the tooltip
hides and resets back to `Loading...`, both of which appear "buggy".

Currently, the image instantly replaces the `Loading...` text without any smooth
transition. How do we make it so the tooltip smoothly transitions in height?
