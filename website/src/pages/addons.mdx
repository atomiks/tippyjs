Addons are external functionality added to Tippy.js that don't need to belong in
the core library. This means users who don't need this functionality aren't
burdened with extra download size. By default, two useful addons are included.

### Event delegation

Event delegation allows you to let a common parent element handle the creation
of tippy instances for child elements.

This allows two things:

- It prevents the need to create new instances for new child elements appended
  to the parent.
- It improves performance as the creation of the tippy instances is deferred
  until they are triggered for the first time.

#### Usage

Your markup should have a structure like this example:

```html
<div class="parent">
  <button class="child">Text</button>
  <button class="child">Text</button>
  <button class="child">Text</button>
</div>
```

Pass a `targets` argument to the `delegate()` addon function (the same type the
`tippy()` function can accept) which represents the parent element(s) that
should act as a delegate, and a `target` prop representing a CSS selector that
should match the child elements which should receive a tippy.

```js
import {delegate} from 'tippy.js';

delegate('#parent', {
  target: '.child',
});
```

In the CDN (IIFE) version, it's available as `tippy.delegate()`

#### Return type

Because `delegate()` can create many different instances, it returns an opaque
value depending on the type supplied, just like `tippy()`.

```js
const delegateInstances = delegate('.parent', {
  target: '.child',
}); // Instance[]

const delegateInstance = delegate(parentElement, {
  target: '.child',
}); // Instance
```

#### Cleanup

By default, when you destroy a delegate instance, it also destroys any child
instances that may have been created by it. If you want to prevent this
behavior, pass `false` as an argument:

```js
const delegateInstance = delegate(parentElement, {
  target: '.child',
});

// Prevents further creation and destroys any created child tippy instances
delegateInstance.destroy();
// Prevents further creation only
delegateInstance.destroy(false);
```

#### Polyfill

This addon uses `Element.prototype.closest()`, which is not supported in older
browsers. You will need to polyfill this method to get full support.

### Singleton

A singleton is a single tippy element that takes the place of an array of
regular tippy instances.

This allows two things:

- Smooth transitions of the tippy between many different reference element
  targets
- Instances with a `delay` can be "grouped" such that appear to share a timeout,
  which greatly improves the UX for elements near each other when their tooltips
  have a delay

#### Usage

Pass an **array** of tippy instances to the `createSingleton` addon function,
and a `delay` prop:

```js
import tippy, {createSingleton} from 'tippy.js';

const tippyInstances = tippy('button');
const singleton = createSingleton(tippyInstances, {delay: 1000});
```

In the CDN (IIFE) version, it's available as `tippy.createSingleton()`

#### Smooth transitions

Utilize the `updateDuration` prop, which is the transition duration between
position updates of the tippy element:

```js
const singleton = createSingleton(tippyInstances, {
  delay: 1000,
  updateDuration: 500,
});
```

The `transition-timing-function` by default is `easeOutQuint`. Usually this
looks nice, but you can change this (to add an inertial slingshot effect for
example) like so:

```js
const singleton = createSingleton(tippyInstances, {
  updateDuration: 500,
  onCreate({popper}) {
    // Any easing function you want.
    popper.style.transitionTimingFunction = 'cubic-bezier(...)';
  },
});
```
