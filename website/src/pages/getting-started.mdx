The package is available on npm:

```bash
# npm
npm i tippy.js

# Yarn
yarn add tippy.js
```

In your application, import the `tippy` module:

```js
import tippy from 'tippy.js'
```

This assumes you're using a module bundler like webpack or Parcel. When
deploying for production, your minifier should remove the development warnings
and error messages.

### Script tags via CDN

Tippy uses `popper.js` as a dependency for positioning. Include these script
tags in your document:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/popper.js@1"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@5"></script>
```

Place them at the very bottom of the `<body>`, ensuring they are placed before
your own scripts. The version numbers after `@` are important, make sure they
don't get removed! They indicate the major version and won't have breaking
changes when new versions get released.

#### Development version

While developing, it's recommended to use the development file which includes
helpful warnings and error messages when something goes wrong:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/popper.js@1"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@5/iife/tippy.bundle.js"></script>
```

When you're finished developing (or deploying for production), you can remove
everything after `@5` (the production file as listed before).

### CSS

Tippy includes a 1 kB CSS stylesheet by default. When including the script link
above, the CSS stylesheet is injected into its own `<style>` tag in `<head>`. If
for some reason you cannot use this, you can include the CSS separately in a
`<link>` tag.

- `tippy.bundle.js` = Main JS + Main CSS injected into `<head>` (default)
- `tippy.js` = Main JS only
- `tippy.css` = Main CSS only

### Frameworks

Tippy.js is making an effort to create official wrappers for various frameworks.
At present, there is an official React wrapper available:

- [@tippy.js/react](https://github.com/atomiks/tippy.js-react)

### JavaScript syntax

This documentation is making use of new JavaScript features (ES6+) that old
browsers like IE11 do not support. Although Tippy.js itself supports IE11, the
code written in these docs may need to be transpiled using a tool like Babel to
a compatible format if you want to copy and paste it.
