The Tippy instance is an individual tooltip object. It has a bunch of properties
and methods that contain information and functionality to manipulate the tooltip
programmatically.

#### Accessing an instance

If you pass an element or virtual element, the instance is directly returned:

```js
const button = document.querySelector('button')
const instance = tippy(button)
// In addition, the instance exists as the `_tippy` property on the element:
button._tippy
```

If you're passing a CSS selector string, NodeList, or an array of elements, then
an array of instances get returned (since potentially many instances can be
created):

```js
const instances = tippy('.btn') // Array
```

#### Auto-initialization

If you're using auto-initialization (`data-tippy` attribute), and you need to
access the instance immediately at runtime, make sure you wrap access in
`setTimeout()`:

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  const button = document.querySelector('button')
  const instance = button._tippy
})
```

`instance` is a plain object with these properties:

```js
{
  id: 1, // 1 to Infinity, used for `aria-describedby` attribute
  reference: HTMLButtonElement, // <button>
  popper: HTMLDivElement, // <div class="tippy-popper">...</div>
  popperChildren: { // Child elements of the parent popper element
    tooltip: HTMLDivElement, // <div class="tippy-tooltip">...</div>
    content: HTMLDivElement, // <div class="tippy-content">...</div>
    arrow: null | HTMLDivElement, // <div class="tippy-arrow"></div>
    backdrop: null | HTMLDivElement, // <div class="tippy-backdrop"></div>
  },
  popperInstance: null, // Instance is lazily created
  props: { ... }, // Instance props + attribute options merged together
  state: {
    isDestroyed: false, // Has the instance been destroyed?
    isEnabled: true, // Is the tippy enabled (can show or hide)?
    isVisible: false, // Is the tippy currently showing (and not transitioning out)?
    isMounted: false, // Is the tippy currently mounted to the DOM?
    isShown: false, // Is the tippy fully shown after finishing transitioning in?
  },
  // This object also contains methods. You'll learn in the next section.
}
```
