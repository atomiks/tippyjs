### Use natively focusable elements

Tooltips should only be applied to natively focusable elements like `<button>`
or `<input>`. Some screenreader software may not announce the tooltip on an
element like `<div>`, even if you add a `tabindex="0"` attribute on it so that
it can receive focus.

### Tooltips are accessible by default

The default trigger for tooltips is `"mouseenter focus"`. This means both a
hover and focus via keyboard navigation will trigger a tooltip. The reference
element receives an `aria-describedby` attribute once the tooltip is fully
shown:

```html
<button aria-describedby="tippy-1">Text</button>
<div id="tippy-1" role="tooltip" class="tippy-popper">
  <!-- inner elements -->
</div>
```

This allows screenreader software to announce the tooltip content describing the
reference element. No work is required by you to achieve this functionality.

### Interactivity

By default, the tippy element is appended to the reference (or `triggerTarget`)
element's parent node. This means elements within the tippy can be tabbed to
once focus has left the reference element, and screenreader users know if the
popover has opened.

This relies on there being no more focusable sibling elements after the
reference element itself.

Before opening the popover:

```html
<div id="parent">
  <button aria-expanded="false">Text</button>
</div>
```

After opening the popover:

```html
<div id="parent">
  <button aria-expanded="true">Text</button>
  <div id="tippy-1" role="tooltip" class="tippy-popper">
    <!-- inner elements, with focusable content -->
  </div>
</div>
```

You should wrap the reference element in its own parent element (`<div>` or
`<span>`) if it's not the only focusable sibling element.

#### Clipping issues

Sometimes, this behavior won't work for your app due to clipping issues. In this
case, you need to specify a custom `appendTo` element outside of the parent node
context and use a focus management solution to handle keyboard navigation.
