Tippy can take a string or HTML element as its `content` prop.

Note that if you want to be able to interact with the content inside the tippy,
you'll need to set `interactive: true`.

### String

```js
tippy('button', {content: '<strong>Bolded content</strong>'});
```

⚠️ Be aware of XSS attacks. Always ensure strings containing user input are
escaped and sanitized properly. To avoid strings being parsed as HTML, set
`allowHTML: false`.

#### Element.innerHTML

You can pass in an elements' `.innerHTML` strings.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<div id="template" style="display: none;">
  <strong>Bolded content</strong>
</div>
```

```js
const template = document.getElementById('template');

// Since we're targeting many different elements, we can pass its `innerHTML`
// as a string
tippy('button', {content: template.innerHTML});
```

You may want to use the `<template>` element instead (though it needs polyfill
for IE11). The content inside a `<template>` does not get rendered, so
network-expensive elements like images won't load until necessary.

### Element

You can pass the element itself, useful for keeping event listeners attached (or
when a framework is controlling elements inside):

```js
const template = document.getElementById('example');
template.style.display = 'block';

tippy(singleButton, {content: template});
```

> **We're passing a single element, so it can only exist in a single tippy since
> it's not being cloned.**

Tippy will move the template from the document into the tooltip.

### Template linking

If you have multiple references each with their own unique template, there is a
way to link them with their associated template:

```html
<button data-template="one">One</button>
<button data-template="two">Two</button>
<button data-template="three">Three</button>

<div style="display: none;">
  <div id="one">
    <strong>Content for `one`</strong>
  </div>
  <div id="two">
    <strong>Content for `two`</strong>
  </div>
  <div id="three">
    <strong>Content for `three`</strong>
  </div>
</div>
```

We can make `content` a function that receives the reference element (button in
this case) and returns template content:

```js
tippy('button', {
  content(reference) {
    return document.getElementById(reference.getAttribute('data-template'));
  },
});
```
