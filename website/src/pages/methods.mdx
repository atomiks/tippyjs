Methods on instances allow you to control the tippy programmatically. See the
[Objects](/objects#instances) section for how to access a Tippy instance.

### Show the tippy

Programmatically show the tippy at any time:

```js
instance.show()
```

### Hide the tippy

Programmatically hide the tippy at any time:

```js
instance.hide()
```

For both the `show()` and `hide()` methods, you can pass a number in as an
argument to use as the animation duration. This will override the instance's
option.

```js
instance.show(1000) // 1000ms
instance.hide(0) // 0ms
```

### Disable the tippy

Temporarily prevent a tippy from showing or hiding:

```js
instance.disable()
```

Re-enable it with this method:

```js
instance.enable()
```

### Destroy the tippy

To permanently destroy and clean up the instance, use this method:

```js
instance.destroy()
```

The `_tippy` property is deleted from the reference element upon destruction.

If you're destroying a delegate instance (i.e., one you created with the
`target` option), pass `true` as an argument to destroy all child instances that
may have been created too.

```js
instance.destroy(true)
```

### Update the tippy

You can update any option after the instance has been created using the `set()`
method. Pass an object of new options in:

```js
instance.set({
  arrow: true,
  animation: 'scale',
})
```

There is also a shortcut for updating the content:

```js
instance.setContent('New content')
```

### Static methods

The `tippy` function module also has static methods available.

#### Create a single tooltip and get its instance

```js
const instance = tippy.one(targets, options)
```

#### Hide all visible tippys on the page

```js
// Hide all poppers
tippy.hideAllPoppers()
// Hide all except a particular instance
tippy.hideAllPoppers(instance)
```

Note that if the instance has `hideOnClick: false`, it won't hide. This will
most likely be changed in the next version.

#### Defaults

You can set the default props for future instances so you don't need to specify
them over and over again. Pass an object of options in:

```js
tippy.setDefaults({
  arrow: true,
  duration: 0,
})
```
