# 5.x to 6.x

Popper.js was updated to v2. The `instance.popperInstance` and `popperOptions`
APIs have changed. You can
[view its documentation here](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/).

## Imports

`iife` and `cjs` were replaced with `umd` (Rollup chunking has been removed).

## HTML Content

To protect against XSS by default, `allowHTML` is now `false` by default. If
you're passing strings of HTML to `content`, you must set `allowHTML: true`.

## Themes

### If you were creating custom themes

<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

`.tippy-tooltip` has become `.tippy-box`, and theming is done via an attribute
now, to match the other props.

The following:

```css
.tippy-tooltip.tomato-theme {
  background-color: tomato;
}
```

Has become:

```css
.tippy-box[data-theme~='tomato'] {
  background-color: tomato;
}
```

> The `~=` attribute operator allows you to specify mutliple theme names like
> before with class names.

For `.tippy-arrow`, you'll need to specify its color on the `::before`
pseudo-element.

The following:

```css
.tippy-tooltip.tomato-theme[data-placement^='top'] > .tippy-arrow {
  border-top-color: tomato;
}
```

Has become:

```css
.tippy-box[data-theme~='tomato'][data-placement^='top'] > .tippy-arrow::before {
  border-top-color: tomato;
}
```

In addition, if you were altering the pixel values, it may need to be adjusted.

In addition, Popper 2 changed some attribute names.

This:

```css
.tippy-tooltip[data-out-of-boundaries] {
  visibility: hidden;
}
```

Has become:

```css
.tippy-box[data-reference-hidden] {
  visibility: hidden;
}
```

</details>

### If you were targeting `.tippy-popper`

<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

`.tippy-popper` is no longer a selector, and is considered an implementation
detail for the most part now. `[data-tippy-root]` attribute selector replaces it
if necessary.

</details>

## Instance

### If you were using `instance.popperChildren`

<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

This no longer exists due to the user's ability to specify any structured DOM
with `render()` (Headless Tippy).

To access the `.tippy-box` element with the default render function
(`.tippy-tooltip` in v5):

```js
const box = instance.popper.firstElementChild;
```

</details>

## Methods

### If you were using `.show()` or `.hide()` with a duration argument

<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

These no longer take a duration argument. Instead, use
`.setProps({duration: ...})` before calling them if necessary.

To replicate `.hide(0)`:

```js
instance.hide();
instance.unmount();
```

</details>

## Props

### If you were using `boundary`

<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

Often, this was to solve a problem in Popper 1, where you set
`boundary: "window"`. This is no longer necessary. If you'd like to change it
anyway, you can set it in `popperOptions`:

```js
tippy(targets, {
  popperOptions: {
    modifiers: [
      {
        name: 'preventOverflow',
        options: {
          // equivalent to boundary: 'window' in v1, usually NOT necessary in v2
          rootBoundary: 'document',
        },
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

</details>

### If you were using `distance` or `offset`

<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

These have been merged into a single `offset` prop, to match Popper 2's new API.

The following:

```js
tippy(targets, {
  offset: 5,
  distance: 10,
});
```

Has become:

```js
tippy(targets, {
  offset: [5, 10],
});
```

This tuple also directly replaces `offset: "5, 10"`.

</details>

### If you were using `flip`, `flipBehavior`, or `flipOnUpdate`

<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

All of these have been removed. To configure these, specify them in
`popperOptions`:

```js
tippy(targets, {
  placement: 'bottom',
  popperOptions: {
    modifiers: [
      {
        name: 'flip',
        // flip: false
        enabled: false,
        options: {
          // flipBehavior: ['bottom', 'right', 'top']
          fallbackPlacements: ['right', 'top'],
        },
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

`flipOnUpdate` has no replacement yet. It's always `true`.

</details>

### If you were using `aria`

<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

This has become an object to allow for better configurability. By default Tippy
will infer what to use (`auto`), but this can be overridden.

Types:

```ts
interface Props {
  // ...
  aria: {
    content?: 'auto' | 'describedby' | 'labelledby' | null;
    expanded?: 'auto' | boolean;
  };
}
```

```js
tippy(targets, {
  aria: {
    // `null` when interactive is enabled
    content: 'auto', // `aria-*` attribute
    // `true` when interactive is enabled
    expanded: 'auto', // `aria-expanded` attribute
  },
});
```

</details>

### If you were using `multiple` or relying on its behavior

<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

Due to static typing issues, it's been removed. Calling `tippy()` again on the
same element will now always create a new tippy for it. Avoid calling `tippy()`
multiple times on the same reference if you don't want multiple tippies created
for it.

</details>

### If you were using `updateDuration`

<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

It's now `moveTransition`, which is a whole transition string. This allows you
to specify the easing function.

```js
tippy(targets, {
  moveTransition: 'transform 0.2s ease-out',
});
```

</details>

### If you were using `lazy`

<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

It's been removed. The `popperInstance` is now created and destroyed on
mount/unmount. If you were using this for ReferenceObjects, see below.

The following:

```js
tippy(targets, {
  lazy: false,
  onCreate(instance) {
    instance.popperInstance.reference = {
      clientWidth: 0,
      clientHeight: 0,
      getBoundingClientRect() {
        return {
          // ...
        };
      },
    };
  },
});
```

Has become a single prop:

```js
tippy(targets, {
  getReferenceClientRect: () => ({
    // ...
  }),
});
```

This implements Popper 2's
[Virtual Elements API](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/virtual-elements/).

</details>

## IE11

IE11 is not supported by default anymore, but can be polyfilled. View the
Browser Support page on the documentation for details.

# 4.x to 5.x

### Node

Make sure you have DEV warnings enabled by setting `NODE_ENV=development` and
ensuring your bundler replaces `process.env.NODE_ENV` with the string
`"development"`.

- **webpack**: via `mode` option
- **Rollup**: via `rollup-plugin-replace`
- **Parcel**: automatic
- **Browserify/Gulp/Grunt/others**:
  [View details](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/deployment.html#With-Build-Tools)

### Browser

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/popper.js@1"></script>
<!-- Specify development file -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@5/dist/tippy-bundle.iife.js"></script>
<!-- 
When you're finished, you can remove everything after @5 
(or when deploying for production) 
<script src="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@5"></script>
-->
```

## Imports

Previously, the default import injected the CSS stylesheet into `<head>`:

```js
import tippy from 'tippy.js';
```

In v5, this import is now side-effect free to work better with dependencies when
users have CSP enabled or using frameworks that control the `<head>`.

You should import the CSS separately:

```js
import tippy from 'tippy.js';
import 'tippy.js/dist/tippy.css';
```

You can however opt-in to use the injected CSS version, just like v4:

```js
// Just like v4
import tippy from 'tippy.js/dist/tippy-bundle.esm';

// Or CommonJS:
const tippy = require('tippy.js/dist/tippy-bundle.cjs');
```

## `data-tippy` attribute

This technique of auto initialization was removed to keep the import side-effect
free. Initializing via the `tippy()` constructor is required.

## Animations

### If you want the `animateFill` effect back (it's no longer default)

<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

Node:

```js
import tippy, {animateFill} from 'tippy.js';
import 'tippy.js/dist/tippy.css';

// These stylesheets are required for it to work
import 'tippy.js/dist/backdrop.css';
import 'tippy.js/animations/shift-away.css';

tippy(targets, {
  animateFill: true,
  plugins: [animateFill],
});
```

Browser:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@5/dist/backdrop.css" />
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@5/animations/shift-away.css"
/>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/popper.js@1"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@5"></script>
<script>
  tippy(targets, {
    content: 'tooltip',
    animateFill: true,
  });
</script>
```

</details>

### If you were using default animations or creating custom animations

<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

- Make sure your `visible` state has no translation (of 0px, instead of 10px
  like before).
- `shift-away`, `shift-toward`, `scale` and `perspective` need to be imported
  separately now.

Node:

```js
import 'tippy.js/animations/scale.css';
```

Browser:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@5/animations/scale.css"
/>
```

</details>

## Props

### If you were using `interactive: true`

<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

When using `interactive: true`, the tippy may be invisible or appear cut off if
your reference element is in a container with:

- `position` (e.g. fixed, absolute, sticky)
- `overflow: hidden`

To fix add the following prop (recommended):

```js
tippy(reference, {
  // ...
  popperOptions: {
    positionFixed: true,
  },
});
```

Or, if the above causes issues:

```js
tippy(reference, {
  // ...
  appendTo: document.body,
});
```

⚠️ For the latter, you need to be employing focus mangement for accessibility.

</details>

### If you were using `arrowType: 'round'`

<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

Import the `svg-arrow` CSS, and the `roundArrow` string, and use the `arrow`
prop instead.

Node:

```js
import {roundArrow} from 'tippy.js';
import 'tippy.js/dist/svg-arrow.css';

tippy(targets, {
  arrow: roundArrow,
});
```

Browser:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@5/dist/svg-arrow.css" />
<script>
  tippy(targets, {
    arrow: tippy.roundArrow,
  });
</script>
```

</details>

### If you were using `followCursor`

<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

Node:

```js
import tippy, {followCursor} from 'tippy.js';

tippy('button', {
  followCursor: true,
  plugins: [followCursor],
});
```

Browser:

(Works as before.)

</details>

### If you were using `sticky`

<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

Node:

```js
import tippy, {sticky} from 'tippy.js';

tippy('button', {
  sticky: true,
  plugins: [sticky],
});
```

Browser:

(Works as before.)

</details>

### If you were using `target`

<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

Use `delegate()`.

Node:

```js
import tippy, {delegate} from 'tippy.js';

delegate('#parent', {target: 'button'});
```

Browser:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/popper.js@1"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@5"></script>
<script>
  tippy.delegate('#parent', {target: 'button'});
</script>
```

</details>

### If you were using `showOnInit`

<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

It's now named `showOnCreate`, to match the `onCreate` lifecycle hook

</details>

### If you were using `size`

<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

It's been removed, as it's more flexible to just use a theme and specify the
`font-size` and `padding` properties.

</details>

### If you were using `touchHold`

<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

Use `touch: "hold"` instead.

</details>

### If you were using `a11y`

<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

Ensure non-focusable elements have `tabindex="0"` added to them. Otherwise, use
natively focusable elements everywhere possible.

</details>

### If you were using `wait`

<details>
<summary>View details</summary>

Use the `onTrigger` and `onUntrigger` lifecycles and temporarily disable the
instance.

```js
tippy(targets, {
  onTrigger(instance) {
    instance.disable();
    // Make your async call...
    // Once finished:
    instance.enable();
    instance.show();
  },
  onUntrigger(instance) {
    // Re-enable the instance here depending on the async cancellation logic
    instance.enable();
