### What syntax theme is used on this website?

It's a theme I made called
[Moonlight](https://github.com/atomiks/moonlight-vscode-theme)!

### Why is there a blue outline around my element?

You may notice a blue outline around your reference element. The blue outline is
called a focus ring; it lets keyboard users know which element on the page is
currently in focus. Most natively focusable elements have this ring by default,
but Tippy adds an attribute to the element so that it can receive focus if it
natively cannot, so that keyboard users (e.g. blind users) can access the
tooltip without using a mouse.

Recommended: only apply the tooltip to natively focusable elements like
`<button>` or `<input>`, otherwise use the `focus-visible` polyfill:
https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible. This will remove the outline for mouse
users but keep it visible for keyboard users.

If your tooltip is **non-essential** (only acts as enhancement), then you can
disable the `a11y` option:

```js
tippy('div', {
  a11y: false,
})
```

### I can't click things inside the tooltip

To enable interactivity, set the `interactive` option to `true`.

### My tooltip is hiding instantly after showing

If you're using a `focus` trigger, for example on an `<input>`, make sure you
also set `hideOnClick: false`.

### My tooltip is not working using `data-tippy`

Make sure Tippy's scripts are placed _before_ your own scripts, at the very
bottom of the page, like so:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button data-tippy="Created automatically">Text</button>
    <button data-tippy-content="Created by function">Text</button>

    <!-- Very end of the body -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/popper.js@1"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@4"></script>
    <script>
      tippy('button')
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Changing data-tippy-\* attributes does not update the tooltip

Updating the data-tippy-\* attribute on an element will currently not update the
tooltip. You must use the [`set()` method](/methods#update-the-tippy) on a Tippy
instance.

For example, let's say you want to update the `theme` for tooltips when changing
between dark and light mode:

```js
const instances = tippy('.example', {
  theme: 'custom-dark',
})

// When clicking the theme toggle button, you can do this:
const newTheme = 'whatever'
instances.forEach(instance => {
  instance.set({ theme: newTheme })
})
```

It's also possible to attach a `MutationObserver` to the reference elements and
observe mutations to attributes if need be, then call `.set()` with the new
values.

### Can I use the `title` attribute?

Yes. The `content` option can be a function that receives the reference element
as an argument and returns a string or element.

```js
tippy('button', {
  content(reference) {
    const title = reference.getAttribute('title')
    reference.removeAttribute('title')
    return title
  },
})
```

The `title` attribute should be removed once you have its content so the
browser's default tooltip isn't displayed along with the tippy.

With the beauty of higher-order functions, you can "enhance" the base tippy
function with new functionality. To add this behavior by default, you can do
something like this at the very top of your scripts before any calls to
`tippy()`:

```js
function withTitleAttributeContent(tippy) {
  return (targets, options = {}) => {
    return tippy(targets, {
      ...options,
      content(reference) {
        if (options.content) {
          return options.content
        }
        const title = reference.getAttribute('title')
        reference.removeAttribute('title')
        return title
      },
    })
  }
}

window.tippy = withTitleAttributeContent(tippy)
```
