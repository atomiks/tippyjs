### Option 1: CDN

Tippy uses `popper.js` as a dependency for positioning. Include these script
tags in your document before your own scripts:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/popper.js@1/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@4"></script>
```

Place them at the bottom of the `<body>`.

### Option 2: Package Manager

Install using either npm or Yarn.

```bash
# npm
npm i tippy.js

# Yarn
yarn add tippy.js
```

Then, import the `tippy` module.

```js
import tippy from 'tippy.js'
```

### Distribution Files

Tippy is distributed in two formats: `umd` (used by the browser and Node
modules), and `esm` (ES6 syntax used by module bundlers like webpack).

- `tippy.js/umd/index.all.js` is Tippy's JS and CSS in a single file. The CSS
  gets injected at the beginning of the document `<head>`.
- `tippy.js/umd/index.js` is Tippy's JS by itself.
- `tippy.js/index.css` is Tippy's CSS by itself.

### Frameworks

Tippy.js is making an effort to create official wrappers for various frameworks.
At present, there is an official React wrapper available:

- [@tippy.js/react](https://github.com/atomiks/tippy.js-react)

### JavaScript syntax

This documentation is making use of new JavaScript features (ES6+) that old
browsers like IE11 do not support. Although Tippy.js itself supports IE11, the
code written in these docs may need to be transpiled using a tool like Babel to
a compatible format if you want to copy and paste it.
