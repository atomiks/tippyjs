### Option 1: CDN

Include this script tag from the unpkg CDN in your document before your own
scripts.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@3/dist/tippy.all.min.js"></script>
```

Place it at the bottom of the `<body>` or in the `<head>` with a `defer`
attribute.

### Option 2: Package Manager

Install using either npm or Yarn.

```bash
# npm
npm i tippy.js

# Yarn
yarn add tippy.js
```

Then, import the `tippy` module and its CSS.

```js
import tippy from 'tippy.js'
import 'tippy.js/dist/tippy.css'
```

### Distribution Files

Tippy is distributed in two formats: `umd` (used by the browser and Node
modules), and `esm` (ES6 syntax used by module bundlers like webpack).

- `tippy.all.js` is all dependencies (`tippy.js`, `popper.js`, and the CSS) in a
  single file. The CSS stylesheet gets injected into the document `<head>`.
- `tippy.standalone.js` is `tippy.js` by itself, externally importing
  `popper.js`.
- `tippy.js` includes `popper.js` bundled.
