There are two ways to install the package.

### 1. Package Manager

```bash
# npm
npm i tippy.js

# Yarn
yarn add tippy.js
```

In your application, import the `tippy` module, and the core CSS:

```js
import tippy from 'tippy.js';
import 'tippy.js/dist/tippy.css';
```

This assumes you're using a module bundler like webpack, Rollup, or Parcel. If
you're getting an error message about `process` inside the browser,
[see the FAQ for help.](../faq/#im-getting-uncaught-referenceerror-process-is-not-defined)

### 2. CDN

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/popper.js@1"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@5"></script>
```

Place them at the very bottom of the `<body>`, ensuring they are placed before
your own scripts. The version numbers after `@` are important, make sure they
don't get removed.

#### Development version

While developing, it's recommended to use the development file which includes
helpful warnings and error messages when something goes wrong:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/popper.js@1"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@5/dist/tippy-bundle.iife.js"></script>
```

When you're finished developing (or deploying for production), you can remove
everything after `@5` (the production file as listed before).

### CSS

Tippy includes a CSS stylesheet by default for the base tooltip styling, fade
animation, CSS arrows, and other required CSS.

#### CDN

When including the script link above via CDN, the CSS stylesheet is injected
into its own `<style>` tag in `<head>`. If you have CSP enabled, you should use
`dist/tippy.iife.js` and link the stylesheet `dist/tippy.css` separately instead
of relying on injection.

#### Contents

[View the package contents on unpkg](https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@5/)

- `dist/tippy-bundle.js` = Core JS + Core CSS injected into `<head>` (default
  for CDN version)
- `dist/tippy.js` = Core JS (default for ESM/CJS versions)
- `dist/tippy.css` = Core CSS

### Optional extra imports

For brevity, this documentation shows imports via a module bundler in Node. If
you're using the CDN, you'll be using `<link>` tags instead.

> **Note**
>
> This is not a required import â€” it's just a demonstration of how you will
> import extra parts of the library depending on your choice when reading the
> documentation.

This optional extra import in the documentation:

```js
import 'tippy.js/animations/scale.css';
```

Is equivalent to this using a CDN in the browser:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@5/animations/scale.css"
/>
```

### Component wrappers

- React: [@tippy.js/react](https://github.com/atomiks/tippy.js-react)

### JavaScript syntax

This documentation is making use of new JavaScript features (ES6+) that old
browsers like IE11 do not support. Although Tippy.js itself supports IE11, the
code written in these docs may need to be transpiled using a tool like Babel to
a compatible format if you want to copy and paste it.
