Extra props are additional props you can use but tend to add a fair amount of
code. Users who don't need this functionality are therefore not burdened with
the extra cost.

Unlike addons, these props get added to the `optionalProps` object. This allows
you to use them like any other prop. The reason is because a prop works better
on a per-instance basis, while addons tend to work better on a group of
instances.

There is currently 1 extra prop:

- `followCursor`

### Usage

In order to use this prop, you need to configure the `tippy` constructor
function.

#### Node

Create a new file and import `tippy` from this file instead of node_modules.

```js
// Only import the extra props you need. The `enhance` helper function is
// required.
import tippy from 'tippy.js'
import enhance, { followCursor } from 'tippy.js/extra-props'

export default enhance(tippy, [followCursor])
```

```js
import tippy from './myTippy'

tippy('button', {
  followCursor: true,
})
```

#### Browser

In the browser, the `tippy` module gets automatically configured. Note that
treeshaking of separate functions is not possible, so instead all of the extra
props are downloaded. It's recommended you use a bundler instead of a CDN.

```html
<!-- Main tippy.js links here -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@5/extra-props/dist/tippy-extra-props.iife.min.js"></script>
<script>
  tippy('button', {
    followCursor: true,
  })
</script>
```
