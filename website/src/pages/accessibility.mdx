### Use natively focusable elements

Tooltips should only be applied to natively focusable elements like `<button>`
or `<input>`. Some screenreader software may not announce the tooltip on an
element like `<div>`, even if you add a `tabindex="0"` attribute on it so that
it can receive focus.

### Tooltips are accessible by default

The default trigger for tooltips is `"mouseenter focus"`. This means both a
hover and focus via keyboard navigation will trigger a tooltip. The reference
element receives an `aria-describedby` attribute once the tooltip is fully
shown:

```html
<button aria-describedby="tippy-1">Text</button>
<div id="tippy-1" role="tooltip" class="tippy-popper">
  <!-- inner elements -->
</div>
```

This allows screenreader software to announce the tooltip content describing the
reference element. No work is required by you to achieve this functionality.
