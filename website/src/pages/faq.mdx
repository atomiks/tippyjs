### Why is there a blue outline around my element?

You may notice a blue outline around your reference element. The blue outline is
called a focus ring; it lets keyboard users know which element on the page is
currently in focus. Tippy adds an attribute to the element so that it can
receive focus if it natively cannot, so that keyboard users (e.g. blind users)
can access the tooltip without using a mouse.

Recommended: use the `focus-visible` polyfill:
https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible. This will remove the outline for mouse
users but keep it visible for keyboard users.

If your tooltip is **non-essential** (only acts as enhancement), then you can
disable the `a11y` option:

```js
tippy('div', {
  a11y: false,
})
```

### I can't click things inside the tooltip

To enable interactivity, set the `interactive` option to `true`.

### My tooltip is not working using `data-tippy`

Make sure Tippy's scripts are placed _before_ your own scripts, at the very
bottom of the page, like so:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button data-tippy="Created automatically">Text</button>
    <button data-tippy-content="Created by function">Text</button>

    <!-- Very end of the body -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/popper.js@1/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@4"></script>
    <script>
      tippy('button')
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
