import { Demo, Button } from '../components/Framework'
import Dropdown from '../components/examples/Dropdown'

It's recommended that tooltips are applied only to natively focusable elements
like `<button>`. Most screenreader software will not announce the tooltip on an
element like `<div>`.

Non-interactive tooltips are accessible by default. The default trigger for
tooltips is `"mouseenter focus"`. This means both a hover and focus via keyboard
navigation will trigger a tooltip.

In addition, the reference element receives an `aria-describedby` attribute
(configurable) once the tooltip is fully shown:

```html
<button aria-describedby="tippy-1">Text</button>
<div id="tippy-1" role="tooltip" class="tippy-popper">
  <!-- inner elements -->
</div>
```

This allows screenreader software to announce the tooltip content describing the
reference element. No work is required by you to achieve this functionality.

### Interactivity

Although non-interactive tooltips are accessible by default, making interactive
tooltips accessible requires a bit of work by you.

For UI elements like dropdowns, you should apply these attributes to the
reference element:

- `aria-haspopup="true"`
- `aria-expanded="false"`

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<!-- The element should have its own wrapper. -->
<div>
  <button aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">Text</button>
</div>
```

The following options are recommended:

```js
tippy('button', {
  interactive: true,
  // `focus` is not suitable for buttons with dropdowns
  trigger: 'click',
  // Don't announce the tooltip's contents when expanded
  aria: null,
  // Important: the tooltip should be DIRECTLY after the reference element
  // in the DOM source order, which is why it has its own wrapper element
  appendTo: 'parent',
  // Let the user know the popup has been expanded
  onMount({ reference }) {
    reference.setAttribute('aria-expanded', 'true')
  },
  onHide({ reference }) {
    reference.setAttribute('aria-expanded', 'false')
  },
})
```

<Demo>
  <Button>Click me then press Tab</Button>
  <Dropdown text="Press enter to click" />
</Demo>

Using this technique, elements within the tippy can be tabbed to since they are
directly after the reference element.

It's also possible to change the `role` of the tippy to something other than
`"tooltip"`:

```js
tippy('button', {
  role: 'menu',
})
```
