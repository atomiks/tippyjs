"Headless Tippy" refers to Tippy without any of the default element rendering or
CSS. This allows you to create your own element from scratch and use Tippy for
its logic only.

This means all props marked with the R symbol in [All Props](../all-props/) no
longer "work" by default, since it's your responsibility to create these
features.

### Usage

This demonstrates the basic usage:

```js
import tippy from 'tippy.js/headless';

tippy(targets, {
  content: 'Hello!',
  render(instance) {
    // The recommended structure is to use the popper as an outer wrapper
    // element, with an inner `box` element
    const popper = document.createElement('div');
    const box = document.createElement('div');

    popper.appendChild(box);

    box.className = 'my-custom-class';
    box.textContent = instance.props.content;

    function onUpdate(prevProps, nextProps) {
      // DOM diffing
      if (prevProps.content !== nextProps.content) {
        box.textContent = nextProps.content;
      }
    }

    // Return an object with two properties:
    // - `popper` (the root popper element)
    // - `onUpdate` callback whenever .setProps() or .setContent() is called
    return {
      popper,
      onUpdate // optional
    };
  }
});
```

### Animations

When using Headless Tippy, animations are not enabled (`animation: false`) by
default. To enable animations, set `animation: true` (or a string) — this will
require you to invoke `instance.unmount()` whenever your hide animation
completes.

```js
tippy(targets, {
  animation: true,
  onHide(instance) {
    // perform your hide animation...
    // once it completes:
    instance.unmount();
  }
});
```

### Mutations

Tippy performs a few mutations to your popper element, so you should avoid
specifying these:

#### Attributes

- `id` attribute is set (for accessibility)
- `data-tippy-root` attribute is set (to allow for nesting)

#### Properties

- `_tippy` property is set on it (to allow for nesting)

#### Styles

- `pointerEvents` is changed based on the `interactive` prop
- `transition` is changed based on the `moveTransition` prop
- `zIndex` is changed based on the `zIndex` prop

### Imports

When using Headless Tippy, all imports (e.g. `followCursor`) should also be
specified from this import, otherwise you will end up with duplicate code bloat.

```js
import tippy, {followCursor} from 'tippy.js/headless';
```
