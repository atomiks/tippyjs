### Option 1: CDN

Include this script tag from the unpkg CDN in your document before your own
scripts.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@3/dist/tippy.all.min.js"></script>
```

Place it at the bottom of the `<body>` or in the `<head>` with a `defer`
attribute.

### Option 2: Package Manager

Install using either npm or Yarn.

```bash
# npm
npm i tippy.js

# Yarn
yarn add tippy.js
```

Then, import the `tippy` module and its CSS.

```js
import tippy from 'tippy.js'
import 'tippy.js/dist/tippy.css'
```

### Distribution Files

Tippy is distributed in two formats: `umd` (used by the browser and Node
modules), and `esm` (ES6 syntax used by module bundlers like webpack).

- `tippy.all.js` is all dependencies (`tippy.js`, `popper.js`, and the CSS) in a
  single file. The CSS stylesheet gets injected into the document `<head>`.
- `tippy.standalone.js` is `tippy.js` by itself, externally importing
  `popper.js`.
- `tippy.js` includes `popper.js` bundled.

### Frameworks

Tippy.js is making an effort to create official wrappers for various frameworks.
At present, there is an official React wrapper available:

- [@tippy.js/react](https://github.com/atomiks/tippy.js-react)

### JavaScript syntax

This documentation is making use of new JavaScript features (ES6+) that old
browsers like IE11 do not support. Although Tippy.js itself supports IE11, the
code written in these docs may need to be transpiled using a tool like Babel to
a compatible format if you want to copy and paste it.
