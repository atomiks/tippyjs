Lifecycle hooks provide a way to run code in response to a certain part of a
tippy's lifecycle.

They are listed here in the usual order in which they occur. Every lifecycle
hook takes the `instance` as its first argument.

#### onCreate

Executed a single time when a tippy is first created.

```js
tippy('button', {
  onCreate(instance) {
    // ...
  },
})
```

#### onTrigger

Executed when a tippy is triggered by a DOM event (e.g. mouseenter, focus,
click), but before it starts to show.

```js
tippy('button', {
  onTrigger(instance, event) {
    // ...
  },
})
```

#### onShow

Executed when a tippy begins to show, but before it gets mounted to the DOM.

You can return `false` to cancel the tippy from showing.

```js
tippy('button', {
  onShow(instance) {
    // ...
    return false // cancels it
  },
})
```

#### onMount

Executed when the tippy element is mounted to the DOM.

```js
tippy('button', {
  onMount(instance) {
    // ...
  },
})
```

#### onShown

Executed when a tippy has fully transitioned in.

```js
tippy('button', {
  onShown(instance) {
    // ...
  },
})
```

#### onUntrigger

Executed when a tippy was triggered by a DOM event (e.g. mouseleave, blur,
click), but before it starts to hide.

```js
tippy('button', {
  onUntrigger(instance, event) {
    // ...
  },
})
```

#### onHide

Executed when a tippy begins to hide and transition out.

You can return `false` to cancel the tippy from hiding.

```js
tippy('button', {
  onHide(instance) {
    // ...
    return false // cancels it
  },
})
```

#### onHidden

Executed when a tippy has fully transitioned out and unmounted from the DOM.

```js
tippy('button', {
  onHidden(instance) {
    // ...
  },
})
```
