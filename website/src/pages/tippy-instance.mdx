A tippy instance is an individual tippy object. It has a bunch of properties and
methods that contain information and functionality to manipulate the tippy
programmatically.

### Accessing an instance

If you pass an element or virtual element to `tippy()`, the instance is directly
returned:

```js
const button = document.querySelector('button')
const instance = tippy(button)
```

If you're passing a CSS selector string, NodeList, or an array of elements, then
an array of instances get returned (since potentially many instances can be
created):

```js
const instances = tippy('.btn') // Array
```

### `_tippy` property

Both the reference element and the popper element have the instance attached as
the `_tippy` property.

Reference element:

```js
const button = document.querySelector('button')
tippy(button)
const instance = button._tippy
```

Popper element (parent of tooltip):

```js
const popper = document.querySelector('.tippy-popper')
const instance = popper._tippy
```

This is especially useful when listening to events on the tooltip and you need
to find which reference element it's associated with.

### Auto-initialization

If you're using auto-initialization (`data-tippy` attribute), and you need to
access the instance immediately at runtime, make sure you wrap access in
`setTimeout()`:

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  const button = document.querySelector('button')
  const instance = button._tippy
})
```

### Shape and properties

`instance` is a plain object. It's best to log it out yourself and investigate
in DevTools:

```js
console.log(instance)
```
