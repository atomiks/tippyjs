A tippy instance is an individual tippy object. It has a bunch of properties and
methods that contain information and functionality to manipulate the tippy
programmatically.

### Accessing an instance

`tippy()` is a generic constructor to **create** tippy instances. It either
returns the tippy instance directly, or returns an array of them.

#### Element

If passing an element directly, the instance is directly returned:

```js
const button = document.querySelector('button');
const instance = tippy(button); // type Instance
```

#### String, NodeList, Element[]

If passing a CSS selector `String`, `NodeList`, or an array of `Element`s, then
an array of instances get returned (since potentially many instances can be
created):

```js
const instances = tippy('button'); // type Instance[] (array)
```

#### `_tippy` property

If you need to access the instance later, this property can be useful if you
didn't assign the instance(s) to a variable. Both the reference element and the
popper element have the instance attached as the `_tippy` property.

```js
const button = document.querySelector('button');
tippy(button);
const instance = button._tippy;
```

### Shape and properties

`instance` is a plain object. It's best to log it out yourself and investigate
in DevTools:

```js
console.log(instance);
```
