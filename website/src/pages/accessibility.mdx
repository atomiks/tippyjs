### Use natively focusable elements

Tooltips should only be applied to natively focusable elements like `<button>`
or `<input>`. Some screenreader software may not announce the tooltip on an
element like `<div>`, even if you add a `tabindex="0"` attribute on it so that
it can receive focus.

### Tooltips are accessible by default

The default trigger for tooltips is `"mouseenter focus"`. This means both a
hover and focus via keyboard navigation will trigger a tooltip. The reference
element receives an `aria-describedby` attribute once the tooltip is fully
shown:

```html
<button aria-describedby="tippy-1">Text</button>
<div id="tippy-1" role="tooltip" class="tippy-popper">
  <!-- inner elements -->
</div>
```

This allows screenreader software to announce the tooltip content describing the
reference element. No work is required by you to achieve this functionality.

### Delays and keyboard navigation

When using keyboard navigation, it's probably best if there are no delays so
that screenreaders can announce the tippy content as soon as possible if focus
is currently on the reference element.

<Demo>
  <Tippy delay={500} duration={[300, 200]}>
    <Button>Normal delay</Button>
  </Tippy>
  <Tippy
    delay={500}
    duration={[300, 200]}
    onTrigger={(instance, event) => {
      if (event.type === 'focus') {
        instance.setProps({ delay: 0, duration: [200, 150] })
      } else {
        instance.setProps({ delay: 500, duration: [300, 200] })
      }
    }}
  >
    <Button>No keyboard delay</Button>
  </Tippy>
</Demo>

```js
const delay = 500
const duration = [300, 200]

tippy('button', {
  delay,
  duration,
  onTrigger(instance, event) {
    // If the tippy was triggered by a `focus` event (e.g keyboard navigation)
    // then set `delay: 0` and reduce the duration a bit.
    if (event.type === 'focus') {
      instance.setProps({ delay: 0, duration: [200, 150] })
    } else {
      instance.setProps({ delay, duration })
    }
  },
})
```
