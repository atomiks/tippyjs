The package is available on npm:

```bash
# npm
npm i tippy.js

# Yarn
yarn add tippy.js
```

In your application, import the `tippy` module:

```js
import tippy from 'tippy.js'
```

This assumes you're using a module bundler like webpack, Rollup, or Parcel. In
development mode, you'll get helpful warnings when things go wrong. When
deploying for production, your minifier should remove the development warnings.
If you're getting an error message,
[read the FAQ for help setting it up.](/faq/#im-getting-uncaught-referenceerror-process-is-not-defined)

Note: webpack defaults to `production` which means you won't get helpful
development messages, but there won't be any error. Use the
[`mode`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/mode/) option to specify
`development` or `production` where necessary.

### Script tags via CDN

Tippy uses `popper.js` as a dependency for positioning. Include these script
tags in your document:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/popper.js@1"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@5"></script>
```

Place them at the very bottom of the `<body>`, ensuring they are placed before
your own scripts. The version numbers after `@` are important, make sure they
don't get removed! They indicate the major version and won't have breaking
changes when new versions get released.

#### Development version

While developing, it's recommended to use the development file which includes
helpful warnings and error messages when something goes wrong:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/popper.js@1"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@5/dist/tippy.bundle.iife.js"></script>
```

When you're finished developing (or deploying for production), you can remove
everything after `@5` (the production file as listed before).

### CSS

Tippy includes a 600 B CSS stylesheet by default for the base tooltip styling,
fade animation, CSS arrows, and other required CSS. When including the script
link above, the CSS stylesheet is injected into its own `<style>` tag in
`<head>`. If for some reason you cannot use this, you can include the CSS
separately in a `<link>` tag.

View the package contents here: https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@5/

- `tippy.bundle.js` = Core JS + Core CSS injected into `<head>` (default)
- `tippy.js` = Core JS only
- `tippy.css` = Core CSS only

### Frameworks

Tippy.js is making an effort to create official wrappers for various frameworks.
At present, there is an official React wrapper available:

- [@tippy.js/react](https://github.com/atomiks/tippy.js-react)

### JavaScript syntax

This documentation is making use of new JavaScript features (ES6+) that old
browsers like IE11 do not support. Although Tippy.js itself supports IE11, the
code written in these docs may need to be transpiled using a tool like Babel to
a compatible format if you want to copy and paste it.
