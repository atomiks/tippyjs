### Instance methods

Methods on instances allow you to control the tippy programmatically. See the
[Tippy Instance](/tippy-instance/) page for details on accessing an instance.

#### show

Programmatically show the tippy at any time:

```js
instance.show(); // Default
instance.show(0); // 0ms transition duration
```

#### hide

Programmatically hide the tippy at any time:

```js
instance.hide(); // Default
instance.hide(500); // 500ms transition duration
```

#### disable

Temporarily prevent a tippy from showing or hiding:

```js
instance.disable();
```

#### enable

Re-enable a tippy:

```js
instance.enable();
```

#### setProps

You can update any prop after the instance has been created. Pass an object of
new props in:

```js
instance.setProps({
  arrow: true,
  animation: 'scale',
});
```

#### setContent

Updating the `content` prop has its own method as a shortcut:

```js
instance.setContent('New content');
```

#### destroy

To permanently destroy and clean up the instance, use this method:

```js
instance.destroy();
```

The `_tippy` property is deleted from the reference element upon destruction.

### Static methods

Static methods belong to the `tippy` module function rather than a tippy
instance.

#### setDefaultProps

Set the default props for each new instance:

```js
import tippy from 'tippy.js';

tippy.setDefaultProps({
  // Props
});

// Access the current default props
tippy.defaultProps;
```

#### hideAll

Hide all visible tippys on the document:

```js
import {hideAll} from 'tippy.js';

// Use each tippy's own duration
hideAll();
// Hide them all instantly
hideAll({duration: 0});
// Hide them all except a particular one
hideAll({exclude: tippyInstance});
hideAll({exclude: referenceElement});
```

Note that this is not attached to `tippy` in ESM/CJS versions, it must be
imported separately. In the CDN (IIFE) version, it's available as
`tippy.hideAll()`.
