| Prop                                                             |              Type               |       Default        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | :-----------------------------: | :------------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `animateFill`                                                    |            `boolean`            |       `false`        | Determines if the background fill color of the tippy should be animated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `allowHTML`                                                      |            `boolean`            |        `true`        | Determines if the tippy can have HTML content rendered inside of it. Make sure you are sanitizing any user data if rendering HTML to prevent XSS attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `animation`                                                      |            `string`             |    `"shift-away"`    | The type of transition animation. Possible values: `"shift-away"`, `"shift-toward"`, `"fade"`, `"scale"`, `"perspective"`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `appendTo`                                                       | `string`, `Element`, `Function` |   `document.body`    | The element to append the tippy to. Use `"parent"` to append it to the reference element's parent node. You can also define a function that takes the reference element as an argument and returns an element.                                                                                                                                                          |
| `aria`                                                           |            `string`             |   `"describedby"`    | The `aria-*` attribute applied to the reference element. Use either `"describedby"` or `"labelledby"`. Use `null` to prevent the attribute from being added (recommended for interactive tippys).                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `arrow`                                                          | `boolean`, `string`, `Element`  |        `true`        | Determines if an arrow should be added to the tippy pointing toward the reference element. **Disabled if `animateFill: true`**. Possible values: `boolean`, `string` (HTML), or `Element` (your own shape).                                                                                                                                                             |
| `boundary`                                                       |     `string`, `HTMLElement`     |   `"scrollParent"`   | The boundary that Popper.js' `preventOverflow` modifier adheres to. Possible values: `"scrollParent"`, `"window"`, `"viewport"`, or an `HTMLElement`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `content`                                                        | `string`, `Element`, `Function` |         `""`         | The content of the tippy. Along with a string or element, you can use a function that receives the reference element as an argument and returns some content.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `delay`                                                          |    `number`, `[show, hide]`     |      `[0, 20]`       | Delay in ms once a trigger event is fired before a tippy shows or hides. Specifying a number means both the show and hide delays are the same. Use `null` in the array to use the default value.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `duration`                                                       |    `number`, `[show, hide]`     |     `[275, 250]`     | Duration of the CSS transition animation in ms. Specifying a number means both the show and hide delays are the same. Use `null` in the array to use the default value.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `distance`                                                       |            `number`             |         `10`         | How far in pixels the tippy element is from the reference element. Only applies to a single axis and not to the parent popper element, see the `offset` prop.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `flip`                                                           |            `boolean`            |        `true`        | Determines if the tippy flips so that it is placed within the viewport as best it can be if there is not enough room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `flipBehavior`                                                   |      `string`, `string[]`       |       `"flip"`       | Determines the order of flipping, i.e. which placements to prefer if a certain placement cannot be used. Use an array such as `["bottom", "left"]` to prefer the "left" placement if "bottom" is unavailable, instead of "top".                                                                                                                                         |
| `flipOnUpdate`                                                   |            `boolean`            |       `false`        | Determines if the tippy should flip when necessary if its position updates while showing (for example, while scrolling, resize, or if the size of the tooltip changed).                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **`followCursor`** (available as an [extra](/extra-props/))      |       `boolean`, `string`       |       `false`        | Determines if the tippy follows the user's mouse cursor. Use the strings `"vertical"` or `"horizontal"` to only follow the cursor on a single axis. Use `"initial"` to place the tippy at the initial cursor position upon show, but prevent following it. On touch devices, `"initial"` is the behavior for all truthy values.                                         |
| `hideOnClick`                                                    |       `boolean`, `string`       |        `true`        | Determines if the tippy should hide if a click event was fired outside of it (i.e. clicking on the reference element or the body of the page). For click-triggered tippys, using `false` will prevent the tippy from ever hiding once it is showing. To prevent clicks outside of the tippy from hiding it but still allow it to be toggled, use the string `"toggle"`. |
| `ignoreAttributes`                                               |            `boolean`            |       `false`        | Determines if `data-tippy-*` attributes on the reference element should be ignored. Increases performance if you enable it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `inertia`                                                        |            `boolean`            |       `false`        | Determines if an inertial slingshot effect is applied to the CSS animation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **`inlinePositioning`** (available as an [extra](/extra-props/)) |       `boolean`, `string`       |       `false`        | Determines if the tippy has enhanced inline positioning support (`display: inline` e.g. `<span>` or `<a>`). Possible values: `boolean`, `"cursor"`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `interactive`                                                    |            `boolean`            |       `false`        | Determines if the tippy is interactive, i.e. it can be hovered over or clicked without hiding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `interactiveBorder`                                              |            `number`             |         `2`          | Determines the size in pixels of the invisible border around a tippy which will prevent it from hiding if the cursor left it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `interactiveDebounce`                                            |            `number`             |         `0`          | Debounces the internal `onMouseMove` handler which determines when an interactive tippy should hide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `lazy`                                                           |            `boolean`            |        `true`        | Determines if the positioning engine (powered by Popper.js) is created lazily. That is, it's only created when necessary upon showing the tippy for the first time. If you need to access the `popperInstance` synchronously after creation, set this to `false`.
