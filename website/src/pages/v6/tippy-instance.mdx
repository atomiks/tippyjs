A tippy instance is an individual tippy object. It has a bunch of properties and
methods that contain information and functionality to manipulate the tippy
programmatically.

### Accessing an instance

`tippy()` creates new instances. It returns a single instance or an array of
instances depending on the type of argument it's supplied.

#### Element

The instance is directly returned, as this represents a single target:

```js
// type Instance
const instance = tippy(document.querySelector('button'));
```

#### String, NodeList, Element[]

An array of instances are returned, as these represent multiple targets:

```js
// type Instance[]
const instances1 = tippy('button');
const instances2 = tippy([element1, element2]);
const instances3 = tippy(document.querySelectorAll('.btn'));
```

#### `_tippy` property

If you need to access the instance later, this property can be useful if you
didn't assign the instance(s) to a variable:

```js
const button = document.querySelector('button');
tippy(button);
const instance = button._tippy;
```

Both the reference element and the popper element have the instance attached as
this property.

### Shape and properties

`instance` is a plain object. It's best to log it out yourself and investigate
in DevTools:

```js
console.log(instance);
```
